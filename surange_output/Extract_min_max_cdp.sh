#Set a variable to the output of a command,
#This variable can be used in other commands
#Be careful: min_cdp=`command output` not min_cdp='command output'

#The ideaï¼š
#1. extract the row containing the required data by using grep
#   Here we find the row by matching the string cdp
#   It shows two matching rows: cdp and cdpt
#2. exclude the row of cdpt by using head, take the first row
#3. delete the sepecial characters ( and ) separately using sed
#4. extract the required data using awk
#   mind the passing variable should be defined again inside awk
